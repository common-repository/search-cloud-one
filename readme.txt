New! Drill into search results using our _Faceted Search_ feature.

How it works:
Take for example a collection of car manuals. Each manual has metadata associated with it, such as 'Brand', 'Form factor' etc.

Using Facet Searching, it's possible to find all of the manuals pertaining to Sedans's by Mercedes, without performing a search request - Instead they are found by clicking 'Mercedes' under brand, 'Sedan' under form-factor and so on.
